# Lineage_tracking_dynamical_environment

Lineage tracking analysis-edit_1_final is a jupyter notebook with commented workflow. I redid the error on the estimator part, worked with pandas, multiprocess when possible, and annotated the code in a more in depth manner than previously. I aslo provided dataset from my simulation code to demonstrate the analysis code.

For now the simulateur notebook is very sparsly commented, but will allow you to simulate your serial dilution barcode evolution experiment in a changing or steady enviromnent, given some ideas of the DFE in your experimental environment and the time series of the changes.

If you have questions or ideas to make the code better, you can find me here : https://ceda.unibas.ch/
